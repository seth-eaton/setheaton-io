        <h1>What is sethtunes?</h1>
	<p>Sethtunes started out as simple exercises (think classes and inheritance) as a means of beginning to learn python and grew into a music data scraping project. At the beginning of the project I had never written a line of python and a few weeks later I deployed a web server that uses four APIs to catalog and archive song data, album reviews, and artist information. Ultimately, sethtunes was an adventure in python, Django, SQLite, AWS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON.</p>
	<p>There is really no point to sethtunes unless you really enjoy minute and a half apple music song previews or seeing pitchfork data aggregated. Personally, I like keeping tabs on new releases and reviews for my favorite artists. I still think of it as a work in progress even though it has taken up too much time and I have to move on to other things. Potential future features include review data from other websites (I want to include metacritic!) and a way to play full songs. I'm not hopeful about the latter feature, though, because youtube blocks embedding videos with copyrighted music and the big streaming services limit access to previews.</p>
	<h3>The gory details</h3>
	<p>The project started out with me reading the basic python documentation and making simple scripts (max 10 lines) to go over python-specific fundamentals: ranges, slices, lists, dicts, and lambda functions. For the portion of the tutorial on inheritance, my first example classes were Pet-Dog-Cat. I then made Song-Album-Artist classes to practice working with data structures composed of custom data types and hard coded Lana Del Rey's discography.</p>
	<p>The whole purpose of the exercise was adding basic functionality to my three classes, and I also created a UserLibrary class that managed all three data types, though this was scrapped in later iterations. I ironed out my understanding of custom data types in python, including the difference between instance and class variables.</p>
	<h3>The advent of sethtunes</h3>
	<p>Hard coding album tracklists quickly became tiresome so I looked into ways of accessing song data from the internet, at which point I came across the iTunes API. I wanted to make a catalog of song titles and album tracklists by some of my favorite artists, taken from the iTunes API and stored in a JSON file. It became clear that the original version of my Song-Album-Artist classes could not be converted to JSON because of a circular reference issue (I never intended for things to get so complicated in the beginning), so I decided to start again.</p>
	<p>At this point the new directory became seth_tunes and the name stuck for me. I started from scratch, making my new version of the data types JSON compatible and started using Beautiful Soup to scrape lists of musicians to add to my database. I originally planned on using the Wikipedia API but found it easier to just scrape the tables from articles such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists" target="_blank">this one</a>. I came across code for an <a href="https://github.com/tejassharma96/pitchfork_api"i target="_blank">unofficial API</a> for the music blog Pitchfork, and in the back of my mind planned on eventually using it, but stuck with a list of my favorite artists. The scripts I wrote queried the iTunes API for artist IDs and then used the ID numbers to find the artists' entire discography, first as albums then as songs. Once I compiled a healthy JSON catalog, I focused on developing a search algorithm, which was honestly a huge headache because of the sheer number of releases and re-releases with similar titles from legacy acts like ABBA and the Beatles. I also started to scrape Pitchfork lists using Beatiful Soup, which wound up being a bit tedious because of the diversity of HTML schema they use.</p>
	<h3>Django in the mix</h3>
	<p>I knew I wanted to build some kind of web server, both for practice and to develop a coding portfolio, so I started to look into options. Between Flask and Django, I chose Django because it seemed more straightforward. I'm still happy with this decision because I find Django to be flexible yet comprehensive. I followed <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> and made the example "polls" app, then got to work on sethtunes.</p>
	<p>My Django models are pretty minimalistic, consisting mostly of field declarations and __str__ functions. I also implemented AdminModels for each model type, which I use to make small tweaks to the catalog, for example duplicates that are not caught automatically, or to delete incorrectly matched pitchfork reviews. I also, of course, had to migrate all the data from my beloved JSON file to the dbsqlite3 database that Django created.</p>
	<h3>My front end sidequest</h3>
	<p>Once I was able to run a server on my local machine and had access to Django's HTML templates, I became a bit obsessed with the interface. I did not have much previous experience with HTML or CSS, mostly a bare-bones webpage I had to create for my Advanced Programming course at Columbia and CSS themes for my tumblr page in middle school. I relied heavily on notation for the entire project, but especially for the CSS design of the webpage. All in all, I am pretty proud of the 2010s nostalgia aesthetic that sethtunes turned out with, and I think the landing page collage of album covers is personally very mesmerizing. Although I found Django's HTML templates to be extremely versatile, there were certain touches that required some basic JavaScript, so I integrated that into the website as well.</p>
    	<h3>The Pitchfork API</h3>
	<p>I loaded the Pitchfork API onto my machine early on in the project and searched for a couple sample reviews, but I did not try to get any information from them. When I tried to actually query the API for full texts, I found out that the whole API was broken. Not a single feature worked. I raised a github issue and the creator of the project told me he hadn't updated the code in four years, during which time Pitchfork had changed their website and made the code unusable. It seemed a promising starting point, though, as the search features still worked and I could not figure out how to get Beautiful Soup to load JavaScript web pages, so I forked the repo and got to work on fixing it.</p>
	<p>This project has been a great jump start to my python journey, but I was still only a week into learning the language and accidentally downloaded the broken version of the API into my binary folder without creating a virtual environment first. Selfishly, I also only fixed the portions of the code that I personally needed. I plan on fixing the entire library and sending a merge request, but for the time being I have adapted parts of the code into my own project rather than using it as an entire package. The matching algorithm I inherited is not entirely perfect, and I opted to go for a wider net, catching the occasional duplicate rather than excluding correct entries. It particularly struggles with self-titled albums and albums for which there has been a re-release or a remix album with a longer, similar title.</p>
    	<p>I hope you will stay a bit and click around. Read the Pitchfork reviews for Coldplay, they're brutal! Search for your favorite artist and see if the algorithm has picked them up yet. Most of all, thanks for checking out the project and visiting my web page.</p>
