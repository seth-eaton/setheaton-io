        <p>I am an empathetic, humanistic full stack developer interested in the intersections between data science and mental health treatment. After two years of experience in web and app development, I am seeking opportunities in mental health tech where I can work on full stack engineering as my primary responsibility. Take a look at my resume <a href="{% static 'homepage/Seth_Eaton_resume.pdf' %}">here</a>.</p></br></br>
        <p>This past year, while taking on freelance development projects, I also studied novel therapies for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, such as virtual reality-based mindfulness, at Manhattan Psychiatric Center. Prior to this work, I have used programming languages ranging from C, Swift, and Python to R, mostly for application development and statistical programming. See my projects page for more!</p></br></br>
        <p>With a degree in computer science and psychology from Columbia University, my hope is to one day utilize technological advancements to treat symptoms of psychosis and other mental health issues.</p></br></br>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy skiing, seeing movies, and listening to music. I spend most days working from home with my chihuahua, Fritz, in my lap. Thanks for visiting!</p></br></br></br>
